1. ἦ l. Frequens conspectus vester, “the sight of your as·
ambly? the awkwardness of the phrase is caused by
frequens being in agreement with conspectus instead of
*being in the gen. plur. between vester and conspectus.
Perhaps it is more natural to take vester conspectus as
meaning “the sight of you” relatively to the speaker,
than to compare it with consessus vester, (=vos qui cou-
sidett‘S,) and to call it a use of the abstract for the concrete.
cf. “scin iis fore meum conspectum invisum‚” Ter. Hec.
v. ii. 22.

Ad agendum amplissimus .· the place was the rostra.
Agere implies dicere, (cf. inf. 5 2, “ ad agendum facultatis
tantum,” &c.,) but is limited to speaking on a question
which the people were to decide with their votes, (roga-
tiones). Itis thus proper to official speakers-

rationes, “the plan‚”“‘ the prInciples.” Cicero is very
fond of this word, and uses it in various senses, which are
not so hard to reconcile if the root-meaning is kept in
victv. “Man,” he says, “has ratio and oratio‚” the
faculties of thought (reor) and speech (oro). The mark
of thought is order, system, method, regularity of course .-
most of the meanings of ratio come from one of these
notions.

prohibuerunt, ‘⁸ withheld me.'’ He had been AEdile and
Quaestor and might thus have spoken from the rostra
had he choseg.
