INTRODUGTION.

 

Tms speech was delivered Rc. 65, and, as Cicero tells
usin the opening sentences, it was the first that he made
in the popular assembly. The occasion of it was the pro·
posal of a law by C. Maniliae, a tribune of the plebs, to give
Pompey full powers to¹ undertake the war with Mith-
ridates. This law was popular with the plebs, in whose
favour Pompey at this time was, and was anxiously de-
sired by the EquiteS‚ whose capital was in danger in Asia.
The high aristocratical party, headed by Catulus and
Hortensius, objected that as Pompey was already clothed
with the immense authority which he received from the
Gabinian laW, to give him this new command would be
merely to place in his hands the whole Roman empire.
Their objections were overruled and the law was carried.
The speech is interesting for many reasons, as shewing
the manner ia which the provinces were misgoverned,

and the consciousness already awakening of the approach
of the Empire. Further historical illustration of the

events‘alluded to in the speech should be sought in the
lives o'f Pompey and of Mithridates in the Dictionary of

Biography.
