cupidorum, “‘greedy ;'’ of. inf. §67, “qua cupiditate
homines in provincias‚'' διο. This point had been
handled before, §133 and some have supposed that all
from “Atque in hoo bello'’ down to §68, “Quod si
auctoritatibus,” δια, is an interpolation. This is hardly
likely.

566. Noverunt, “they know ,·” noscere, “to come to know,”
“to reoognise.”
hostium simulatione, ,“ with the enemy as a pretext.'’
animos ac spiritus, ᾄσῃ “ can satisfy the exacting
temper, Ι do not say of a general, but of a single tribune
of the soldiers.” Capera is the Gr. χωρεῖν, “to oontain.'’

XXIII. m'si erit idem, qui se, ᾄσῃ “you may consider him
able to defeat the king’s armies in a pitohed battle, but
unless you are sure that he will likewise be able to

restrasin himself‚” &mx se is amplified below by ma-

Romanum non locupletari quotannis pecunid publica praeter
paucos, neque nos quidquam aliud, ‘3⁴⁰- ,- ⁴⁴ For the people
of the coast saw that the Roman people was not eanohed
year by year with the money which was exacted from
themselves, and that all the good we had of our fieets
was that they covered us with shame.” But this is hard,
and the tone of the assage is rather that the “publio
money” voted for {sets went to enrioh the corrupt
praetors, who (with few exception-5) embezzled it, and
brought in no return for it but loss and shame to
Rome.
