in any account2’' Others read aliquo, which is very
hard} perhaps it may be best to take aliquo in numero,
not (as ullo in numero is) in close connection with the
predicative verb putare, but to attach it as an attributive
adj. phrase to imperatorem,—-“ whom can we consider a
commander worthy of the name P' &c. We might say,
“Imperator si non bonus at certe aliquo in numero
putandus est,’' in the oratio directa5 and “imperator
aliquo in numero” has to be kept together as one sub·
stantiae in this sense if it is ¹to be used here at all, else
aliquo is impossible. The difficulty is much the same
as if we found a relative clause with the verb in indicative
mood in the middle of an indirect passage.

cujus, ‹sm-..- the person alluded to here is uncertain.
Some think that “neque enim potest exercitum is con-

ς 39. ut non modo...sed ne...quidem .- here non modo is for non
modo non.- this can only happen where it is followed by
rte—quidem, and both are attached to the same verb.
“Not the mark of their foot. much less of their hond.''

hiemis...avarit1ae‚ “ a refuge from winter..for the grati-
fication of greed.'’

XIV. §40. non nobilitas urbis ad cognitionems “to visit
