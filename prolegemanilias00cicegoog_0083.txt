Archias had been much away from Rome. In mc. 86 and
mc. 7 0, when the census was taken, Archias was with
L. Lucullus in Asiae and while he wa· in Rome, during·
the interval, there wan no census, He had, however, oppor-
tunitics of acting· as a citizen by making his will according
to Roman law, by entering· on hequents, and by his name
being cent in to the treasury by L. Lucullus in beneficiis,
(5 11). Thia concluded the legal questionz the rest of the
speech in an eulogy of Archias· poetical powers, and of the
study of philosophy.

ιιι in thi- omina.
